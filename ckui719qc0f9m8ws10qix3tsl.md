### What's up?

When I started writing in [hashnode](hashnode.com), I always thought that I should come up with content that was related to tech. Especially since I started to learn about web development through [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/). And hashnode is full of tech people of different stacks. 

But they actually said that [they're not exclusive to tech](https://twitter.com/hashnode/status/1440200583206428672). So I figured, since I have a lot of things in mind that I like to address as another human being, I might as well take advantage of the platform. Plus, the UI/UX is already great. 

### So?

So I'm going to post with various topics like personal blogs, current events, social issues ranging from one's self to family to society. I had spent a lot of time touch-typing on  [MonkeyType](monkeytype.com)  that it came to a point that maybe I should make something out of my 122 wpm typing speed. 

I hope my essays can be of value to you, or entertaining at least. And if you happen to want to read more (yay!), be my guest! *Gagamit din ako Tagalog para sa aking mga minamahal kong kababayan, pero baka bihira lang.*

If you're not a tech person, you can just skip the tech articles. I don't want to remove any more evidence that I've started just because I've failed to be consistent with writing. 

For my tech blogs, I think I'll just create another page for that (or host them in GitHub). 

### Keeping a schedule

I appreciate the `subscription feature` of hashnode very much. So I was hoping to keep you all posted at least once a week. Hopefully, every Friday at 6:00 PM (+8:00 GMT). So if you're not yet subscribed, consider doing so! 

Til then, see ya!
